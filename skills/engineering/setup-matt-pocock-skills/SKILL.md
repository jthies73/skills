# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker**: where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- **Triage labels**: the label strings each canonical triage role maps to
- **Domain docs**: where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config`: is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root: does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/`: does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/`: a sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use
- Is the `triage` skill installed? (a `triage` skill folder alongside this one, or `triage` in your available skills.) This decides whether Section B runs at all.
- Board signals: existing labels that read as columns (`TODO`, `In Progress`, `Doing`, `Review`, `Blocked`), or an issue board configured on the remote. These make Section B's answer near-certain before you ask it.
- Monorepo signals: a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, a `workspaces` field in `package.json`, or a populated `packages/*` with its own `src/`. These are present only in a genuinely large multi-package repo; their absence means single-context, which is almost every repo.

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then take the sections in order. One section, one answer, then the next.

Lead each section with the recommended answer so the user can accept it in a word. Give a one-line explainer only when the choice genuinely branches; skip the section entirely when exploration already settled it (Section B when `triage` isn't installed, Section C when there's no monorepo).

**Section A: Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-tickets`, `triage`, and `to-spec` read from and write to it. They need to know whether to call `gh issue create`, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: these skills were designed for GitHub. If a `git remote` points at GitHub, propose that. If a `git remote` points at GitLab (`gitlab.com` or a self-hosted host), propose GitLab. Otherwise (or if the user prefers), offer:

- **GitHub**: issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab**: issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI)
- **Local markdown**: issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/` in this repo (good for solo projects or repos without a remote)
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.): ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

Record the choice in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. The GitHub and GitLab templates carry a "PRs as a request surface" flag, defaulted **off**. Leave it off and don't raise it: a user who wants external PRs in the triage queue can flip the flag in the file later.

They also carry two **landing conventions** `land-the-work` reads, both fine to leave at their defaults. A **default reviewer**, defaulted to none: only raise it on a repo with more than one contributor, and never propose the user's own account, since the host refuses a review request from the request's own author and that setting breaks every publish. And **merging closes the referenced issue**, defaulted to yes: leave it there on a board, where the merge is what moves a card from Review to Done, and raise it only where the user says they close issues by hand well after merging.

**Section B: Triage label vocabulary.** Skip this section entirely if the `triage` skill isn't installed (exploration told you), since an uninstalled skill needs no labels.

If it is installed, ask exactly one question:

> Do you run a kanban board for this repo? (recommended: **yes**)

- **Yes** → write `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` from the [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md) seed. Five board lists (Backlog / TODO / In Progress / Review / On Hold, plus the host's built-in Closed list as Done), column labels on **Deliverables** only, Done carried by the closed state, `Backlog` carried by a real label because no board can build a list out of the absence of one, and `wontfix` labelled so closed-and-shipped stays distinguishable from closed-and-discarded.
- **No** → write it from [triage-labels-flat.md](./triage-labels-flat.md): the five canonical roles, each mapping to one label of the same name.

A board answer **includes the in-flight roles** and there is no asking about it: `In Progress` and `Review` are columns, so the roles that move a card into them have to be named. On the flat mapping they stay the optional section they are today, left out unless the user wants `implement` to claim and `land-the-work` to move.

Either way, if the user's tracker already uses other names (e.g. `bug:triage` for `needs-triage`, or German column names), collect the overrides so `triage` applies existing labels instead of creating duplicates. A role maps to **zero or more** labels, so an override can add a column label to a role or remove one entirely.

**Then verify the labels exist.** A mapping table asserting labels nobody created is worse than no table, because every skill reads it as fact. Using the label operations in the tracker seed, list what exists and report the mapping's labels as present or missing. Offer to create the missing ones, and don't create anything without being asked.

On GitLab, ask for the **group path** first (`dev`, `dev/platform`) if the board spans more than this repo: a group-level board can only build its lists from **group** labels, so that is where they belong, created once for every repo under it. On repo two onward this section finds everything present and is one line. GitHub has no organisation-level labels, so there the vocabulary is per-repo and gets created every time.

**Section C: Domain docs.** Default to **single-context** (one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root). This fits almost every repo; write it without asking.

Offer **multi-context** (a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files) only when exploration found monorepo signals. Then confirm which layout they want.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` (the last only when `triage` is installed)

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create; don't pick for them.

Never create `AGENTS.md` when `CLAUDE.md` already exists (or vice versa); always edit the one that's already there.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout: "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Include the `### Triage labels` sub-block, and write `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, only when `triage` is installed and Section B ran. When it isn't, both are omitted.

Then write the docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-github.md](./issue-tracker-github.md): GitHub issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-gitlab.md](./issue-tracker-gitlab.md): GitLab issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md): local-markdown issue tracker
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md): role-to-label mapping, board-shaped (only if `triage` is installed)
- [triage-labels-flat.md](./triage-labels-flat.md): the same mapping for a repo with no board, one label per role
- [domain.md](./domain.md): domain doc consumer rules + layout

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later; re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
